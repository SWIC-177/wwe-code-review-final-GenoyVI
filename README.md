# WWE Final Reflections

## Shorthand and Array hand

In my experience using elements from javascript, It never occurred to me to so frequently use the range of use for `import` and `export`, to be frank I wasn't rally confident on how to refer to them contextually as they have very apparent and vital use in more of the files overall.

creating a `search engine` for instance is something that sounded impossibly out of reach before and is now more practically laid out for me with context in this, specifically `main.js`.

array from seperately placed, to array objects, and to function objects all at once was giving me a bit of trouble perceptively but i could under the the general use of the overall code instantly by knowing the reference and the structure with use of `tailwind` commonly from experience.

Their are many functions used on this form used for quality of life that i hadn't applied very much in my own work but seeing as the end result of them is saved time; i would be annoyed with the guy who made using his program needlessly difficult as well.

## Not 100% sure report

there are a few things i felt i was understanding usefulness of but in a way that springs the question to the philosophy of what useful was to user as opposed to useful for the read/programmer. making several methods and functions appear either partially redundant or not totally useful. as example

```
 get searchState() {
    return this.#search;
  }

  set searchState(value) {
    this.#search = value;
  }
}
```

The `search` keyword of course is used to filter data but in this instance it appears to be used for background element use that wouldn't be visible on the document in use.
`@param` can be used to _identify a document_ but i haven't seen unique use for it outside of the way it looks.

### Reviews

we also used `event listener` and several boolean operators in several forms over again, the new parts to me weren't as difficult to understand as how they could influence the old parts like arrays as objects and reassignment not particularly being as available in the doc, is still in the search keywords reference for large complications. i over thought a few things in the main.js file that seem ridiculous after reading the `lib` files.
